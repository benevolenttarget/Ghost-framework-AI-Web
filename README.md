I attempted to correct some problems for ghost and create a GUI and put it on.
its own webserver it would be cool to get pointers 
and the like on how i can make it better will have an update too soon.
Credit goes to EntySec for this original android post exploited framework 
so thanks. and also going to try to build a gui ios style framework for post exploiting iphone via android so lets focus my app in that direction.
must have adb preinstalled on device prior to running this app.
